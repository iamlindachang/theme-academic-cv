## Who am I?

This is my academic research page. I was formerly a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Operations, Information, and Decisions Department](https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu/) at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (on a [MindCORE](https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/) Postdoctoral Research Fellowship).

As a postdoctoral research fellow, I studied judgment and decision with a focus on (1) understanding decision-making processes in organizational contexts and (2) increasing diversity, equity, and inclusion. My work integrates insights and methods from organizational behavior, social psychology, behavioral economics, and computational neuroscience. I have employed online, laboratory, and field experiments, used computational methods, and analyzed archival data sets.
